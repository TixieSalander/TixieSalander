Starting 2024, I'm focusing full-time into my own smaller organization: ‚à¥[Gu√©rilla.Studio](https://github.com/GuerillaHQ), my ‚Äú*two-women-one-cat-in-a-trenchcoat* little collective‚Äù as I like to call it. \
We work our very best at making a web a little bit more **inclusive**, **accessible**, and ~~anti-capitalist~~ **ethical** by making & maintaining independent software along with helping other organizations and open-source initiatives embracing those values.

We made for example:
